# 煩い猫 (Bossy Cat)

This silly project is an 3D-printed lucky cat statue that will light up once every day and will "fall back asleep" once you press the button on its pedestal. It's an over-engineered way for me to remind myself to help my cat out, like cleaning the litter box and refilling the cat feeder. For now, only the cat statue and arcade button will light up, but in the future I might add a speaker that makes meowing sounds with increasing frequency until the button is pressed.
